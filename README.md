# Bookshelf
Bookshelf wordpress plugin 
Background Story:

"Once upon a time, in a land known as 'Webville', citizens were book lovers. They read and shared books with each other all the time. But, as the number of books grew, it became hard for them to manage their collections. They needed a way to keep track of all the books they had, the ones they had lent out, and the ones they wished to get. 

Our hero, an innovative full-stack developer, was touched by their plight and decided to help. He planned to create a magical artefact, a WordPress plugin named 'Bookshelf'. This plugin would allow the citizens to maintain an online record of their book collections, share their collection with friends, and add books they wished to buy to a wishlist. 

It's your turn to take the role of the developer hero and help the citizens of Webville!"

# Task:

Create a WordPress plugin named 'Bookshelf', which allows users to:

1. Add Books: Users should be able to add books to their bookshelf. Details to include would be - Title, Author, Genre, Publication Year, Cover Image and a short description of the book.

2. View Collection: The plugin should display the users' book collection in an attractive and user-friendly layout.

3. Share Collection: Provide an option to share the user's book collection via a unique URL.
